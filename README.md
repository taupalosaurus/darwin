#Description
Code for the resolution of a time-dependant non-linear advection problem using 
Firedrake.

The problem solved comes from: LEVEQUE, Randall J. High-resolution 
conservative algorithms for advection in incompressible flow. SIAM Journal on 
Numerical Analysis, 1996, vol. 33, no 2, p. 627-665.

The adaptation method comes from: BARRAL, Nicolas. Time-accurate anisotropic 
mesh adaptation for three-dimensional moving mesh problems. 2015. Th√®se de 
doctorat. Paris 6.
